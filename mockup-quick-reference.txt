All mockups can be edited in any text editor:

- Change clan names/grades: Edit text directly in HTML
- Change colours: Search and replace hex codes
- Change text: All copy is in the <body>, not templated
- Add/remove sections: Each section is self-contained

No CSS frameworks, no build tools, no dependencies.

- Embed screenshots of Fantasy Dashboard (technical rigor)
- Link to Scroll Story (public impact)

For social media:
- Screenshot from Scroll Story (bold, punchy)
- GIF of Fantasy Dashboard heatmap (technical appeal)
- Quote from Dark Academia copy (authoritative)
