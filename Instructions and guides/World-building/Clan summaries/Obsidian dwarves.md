Yes! While “Obsidian” dwarves weren’t in your original list, they’re a fantastic addition — we can treat them as a rare or secretive offshoot, perhaps culturally or geographically distinct from the main six clans. Here’s a full fact sheet for the **Obsidian Dwarves**:

---

### 🪨 Obsidian Dwarves — Clan Profile

**Known As:** The Nightforged  
**Region:** The Deep Mirror — a labyrinth of volcanic tunnels, obsidian cliffs, and lightless echo-chambers far beneath the surface, where heat and silence reign  
**Language/Dialect:** Vulkarn — a deep-throated, slow dialect barely spoken above a murmur, meant to travel through stone rather than air. Its songs can crack glass and still water.

---

### 🌑 Homeland & Environment

- The Deep Mirror lies in the forgotten bowels of the world — a region of volcanic glass, mirrorstone, and magma-choked vaults.
    
- Their cities are faceted and smooth, built from obsidian and basalt, lit by molten channels and glowing fungi.
    
- Light is scarce and ritualised; most spaces are dim or reflective, designed to warp and redirect ambient glow.
    

---

### 🗣️ Language & Expression

- Vulkarn is tonal and seismic. Many messages are tapped, echoed, or sung into stone rather than spoken aloud.
    
- Obsidian dwarves rarely raise their voices — silence is etiquette, and loudness is seen as spiritually violent.
    
- Written forms are etched into reflective surfaces, with meaning revealed only at specific angles or under heatlight.

### 🔮 Culture & Traditions

- **The Mirrorwake:** At adolescence, a dwarf must sit alone in a dark obsidian chamber and speak their name into the void. When the echo returns altered, they adopt its form as their true name.
    
- **Stillcasting:** Artisans shape mirrorstone into divinatory shards that show not the future, but hidden truths — or one's own flaws.
    
- **Glassblades:** They forge ritual weapons of obsidian — delicate, razor-thin, and never meant for war, only ceremony and judgment.
    

---

### 💠 Values

- **Truth through shadow** — they believe what is hidden is not false, only incomplete.
    
- They revere **introspection**, **restraint**, and the courage to face one’s reflection — literally and figuratively.
    
- Value **artistry under pressure**, like the volcanic forces that shape their world.
    

---

### 💼 Livelihoods

- Masters of **glasscraft**, **mirrorstone divination**, **resonance-forging**, and **shadow architecture**.
    
- Often employed as **vault-makers**, **crypt designers**, **stealth engineers**, or **truthsayers** by those who can afford their discretion.
    
- Create precision instruments for use in dark environments — silent hinges, thermal tools, echo-sensors.
    

---

### 🔥 Religion & Belief

- Worship **Nyzrak the Hidden Flame**, a faceless entity of reflection, containment, and inward fire.
    
- Their rituals are performed in silence and darkness, often facing obsidian mirrors or pools of black water.
    
- They believe sins must be named into stone and then buried beneath glass.
    

---

### 🖤 Physical Characteristics

- Deeply pigmented skin in shades of coal, ash, and lava-glass; sometimes iridescent under firelight.
    
- Hair is often pitch black or silver-streaked, worn long and unbound to soften their stark features.
    
- Eyes are reflective and glassy — ranging from onyx and garnet to gold-flecked violet.
    

---

### 🧿 Folklore & History

- Legend tells of **Vaerun the Unseen**, who carved a perfect mirror and was pulled into it, returning only when the world was ready to look back.
    
- They recount the tale of **The Shard of Guilt**, a blade that never cuts flesh, only illusion — said to weigh more when lies are spoken nearby.
    

---

### 🪞 Social Standing & Relations

- Considered eerie or uncanny by surface dwarves; some deny their existence, treating them as myth.
    
- Malachite and Gypsum dwarves speak of them respectfully; Granite and Flint often scorn them as "buried cowards".
    
- Elves find them fascinating but unnerving — particularly Baobab and Yew scholars, who collect their mirrorstone art with reverence.
