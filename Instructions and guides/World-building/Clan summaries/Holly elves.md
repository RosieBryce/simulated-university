Here is your detailed fact sheet for the **Holly Elves**:

---

### 🌿 Holly Elves — Clan Profile

**Known As:** The Winterwatch or Thornwardens  
**Region:** The Bleeding Glades — a dense, frost-hardened woodland where holly grows in tangled thickets and red berries stain the snow.  
**Language/Dialect:** Ithalen — a crisp, tonal dialect full of sharp consonants and flowing intonation. It sounds like frost cracking, with a poetic form built around half-rhymes and breath.

---

### ❄️ Homeland & Environment

- The Bleeding Glades are evercool, even in summer. Snow often lingers in the shadows beneath thorny canopies.
    
- Holly trees are revered and protected. Entire groves are tended like living libraries — pruned into paths, shelters, and ritual shapes.
    
- Settlements are woven into nature — **living treehouses**, **thorn-ringed halls**, and **frosted archways** carved from snow and bark.
    

---

### 🗣️ Language & Expression

- Ithalen is spoken with restraint and intention. Every word is weighed like a blade.
    
- Poetic speech is common in diplomacy and ritual; metaphor is preferred over directness.
    
- Silence holds great meaning — to speak unnecessarily is a breach of grace.

### 🌲 Culture & Traditions

- **The Thornfasting:** Adolescents must spend a winter alone in the holly woods with only a knife and their breath. They return with a story, a scar, and a new name.
    
- **The Berry Vigil:** During winter solstice, Holly elves offer red berries to the snow as a sign of endurance and remembrance for the lost.
    
- **Songthorns:** Living thorns enchanted to resonate with the songs of ancestors — used in storytelling, memory-keeping, and warnings.

### 💠 Values

- **Endurance in adversity** — winter tests all, and only those who endure are worthy of trust.
    
- **Protection of the weak** — like holly shields the forest floor from wind, Holly elves guard the vulnerable.
    
- Deep reverence for **memory**, **ritual**, and the **hard wisdom of age**.
    

---

### 💼 Livelihoods

- Renowned **scouts**, **wardens**, **healers**, and **ritual guardians**.
    
- Experts in protective magic, cold-weather survival, herbal lore, and the crafting of **thornsteel** — a light but serrated metal.
    
- Their tapestries, made from red thread and woven bark, tell histories unreadable to outsiders.
    

---

### ❄️ Religion & Belief

- Honour **Velentha the Crimson Vigil**, a cold goddess of memory, thorns, and the endurance of grief.
    
- Shrines are made of red berries frozen in crystal, placed where frost lingers longest.
    
- Believe that the wind carries voices of those who have passed — to be still in winter is to hear them.
    

---

### 🌿 Physical Characteristics

- Pale or frosted skin with undertones of lavender, ice-blue, or moss-green.
    
- Hair tends to be dark — black, evergreen, or crimson — and often worn long and braided with leaves or thorn charms.
    
- Eyes are piercing: icy grey, berry-red, or deep forest green.
    

---

### 🧿 Folklore & History

- Tell of **Nerya the Last-Leaf**, who held a blizzard at bay for seven days by planting holly in her chest and singing to the storm.
    
- Cautionary tales of **The Unguarded Glen**, where those who ignored winter warnings vanished without a trace.
    

---

### 🪞 Social Standing & Relations

- Respected but viewed as aloof or overly serious by other elven clans.
    
- Hold long grudges — even elves forget faster than Holly elves forgive.
    
- Tense alliance with **Flint dwarves**, forged in old frost-wars; mutual admiration with **Malachite dwarves** who share a reverence for endurance.
