Here is the final entry in your dwarven clans: the **Slate Dwarves**.

---

### 🪨 Slate Dwarves — Clan Profile

**Known As:** The Shardbound  
**Region:** The Grey Reaches — wind-scoured plateaus and shearing cliff faces where great layers of slate crack, tilt, and fall like old books in a ruined library  
**Language/Dialect:** Tharn — a terse, scratchy dialect with a dry cadence and minimalism in structure. Many words are used as both noun and verb, with tone providing context. The written form is usually etched or scratched into stone tablets.

---

### 🌫️ Homeland & Environment

- The Grey Reaches are a stark, fractured land of broken strata and ever-shifting shelves of slate. Avalanches are common, and paths are precarious.
    
- Villages are built into tight crevices, reinforced with support braces, and insulated against the highland winds. Most buildings are stacked, layered, and quietly beautiful in their simplicity.
    
- Colours are muted: grey stone, moss green, soot brown. Their aesthetic is deliberate restraint.

### 🗣️ Language & Expression

- Tharn is economical: the fewest words for the most meaning. Silence carries its own syntax.
    
- When written, messages are scored lightly into slate tiles or passed using gestures and etched tokens.
    
- Debate is rare. Agreement is typically signalled with a nod or a still hand. Disagreement is a pause — long, heavy, and absolute.

### 🛠️ Culture & Traditions

- **The Breaking Day:** At adulthood, each dwarf must split a hand-carved slate slab down a chosen fault line. If the break follows the pattern perfectly, they are considered ready to take on adult responsibility.
    
- **Shard Tokens:** Every citizen carries a broken piece of their family’s hearthstone. If they ever sever ties, it must be returned.
    
- **Stone Telling:** Elders teach history by placing chips of slate into sand-trays, each one representing an idea, loss, or warning. The tray is wiped clean at the end of each telling.

### 💠 Values

- **Reliability over brilliance** — they prize those who endure, who show up, who brace the wall when it cracks.
    
- **Stillness as strength** — rashness and noise are seen as dangerous indulgences.
    
- They honour **fracture** — not as failure, but as testimony. Every scar is a line of survival.
    

---

### 💼 Livelihoods

- Found in **infrastructure repair**, **keystone masonry**, **load-bearing design**, and **burial architecture**.
    
- Masters of tension analysis, slope stability, and quiet defensive engineering.
    
- Often serve in roles of **caretaking**, **maintenance**, and **disaster response** — rarely in command, but often the last standing.
    

---

### ⚫ Religion & Belief

- Honour **Durren of the Final Brace**, a silent, genderless guardian said to hold up the world’s last crumbling arch.
    
- Shrines are little more than exposed stone with hand-scratched sigils.
    
- Their rituals are simple: sitting vigil through a storm, patching a faultline, remaining present when others leave.
    

---

### 🌫️ Physical Characteristics

- Ash-grey to charcoal skin, sometimes marked with faint natural striations like sediment layers.
    
- Hair tends to be fine, straight, and muted in colour — iron grey, slate blue, deep brown.
    
- Eyes are narrow and often downcast, in hues like stormcloud, smoke, or stone-dust.
    

---

### 🧱 Folklore & History

- They tell of **The Dwarf Who Sat the Avalanche**, who stilled a landslide by simply sitting in its path, unmoving, until the mountain shifted around them.
    
- Stories are often instructional — warnings passed in gesture or touch: a cracked tile, a worn step, a crooked shadow.
    

---

### 🪞 Social Standing & Relations

- Underestimated by most clans — seen as humourless, slow, or background. But in times of hardship, all turn to the Slate.
    
- Deep affinity with **Alabaster** and **Gypsum** dwarves — mutual recognition of quiet endurance.
    
- Little contact with elves, though **Yew elves** may seek them out when things are falling apart.
