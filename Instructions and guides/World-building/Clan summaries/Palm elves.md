### 🌴 Palm Elves — Clan Profile (Refined)

**Known As:** The Tidebound, the Wayfarers, the Brightkind (or more quietly, the Drowned Lineage)  
**Region:** The Whispering Reaches — a coastal jungle archipelago marked by sea cliffs, tidal caverns, and towns strung between tree and reef. Once a sprawling elven archduchy, now scattered remnants bound by salt, song, and memory.  
**Language/Dialect:** _Lumea_ — a melodic, cadence-rich tongue with tones meant to carry over wind and wave. It's often sung or whistled, and contains layered meanings; what sounds like flirtation may carry grief or prophecy beneath.

---

### 🌊 Homeland & Environment

- The Whispering Reaches are lush but unstable. Monsoons reshape coasts, reefs shift like bones, and old cities lie sunken offshore — lost to storms and empire.
    
- Homes are stilted, rooted in palms or cliffs, designed to sway and yield. Nothing is permanent except the sea.
    
- **Every family can name an island that no longer exists.** Displacement is a living memory.
    

---

### 🗣️ Language & Expression

- Lumea is poetic and indirect — **a language of tides**. Words curl back on themselves, often saying more by what is implied than what is said.
    
- Expression is layered: **hands dance when mouths speak**, and eyes often contradict smiles.
    
- Palm Elves learn early how to perform joy even when they don’t feel it — not to deceive, but to protect one another.

### 🌴 Culture & Traditions

- **The Windwalk:** A solitary rite where a youth travels to the ruins of a drowned island and listens for their ancestors in the surf.
    
- **Festival of First Fruit:** A ritual not just of offering, but of remembrance — every fruit is named after someone who didn’t return from the tide.
    
- Storytelling is an act of preservation — tales are retold not to entertain but to remember who they were _before the drowning_.
    

---

### 💠 Values

- **Joy as defiance** — To laugh is to declare: _you did not break me_.
    
- **Movement as memory** — Staying still invites forgetting; to move is to carry stories onward.
    
- **Generosity as mourning** — Giving honours the ones who had nothing left to give.
    

---

### 💼 Livelihoods

- Renowned **navigators** who map not just currents but grief — tides of history and heartbreak.
    
- Spellcraft includes **current-summoning**, **fog-binding**, and **salt-magic** (used to cleanse, preserve, or conceal).
    
- Many become **perfume-makers** or **ritual healers**, encoding memory and meaning in scent and touch.
    
- Their arts carry coded histories: a dance may tell of exodus, a fermented drink of mourning.
    

---

### 🌊 Religion & Belief

- Worship **Alani the Shifting Current**, a god once known as “the Laughing Current,” but now more often prayed to in silence.
    
- Shrines are ephemeral — a reflection of life’s impermanence — drawn in sand or sea foam, offered back before tide or wind can erase them.
    
- **Death is not an ending but a dispersal** — a Palm Elf never truly leaves, they dissolve into the tide and sing back in waves.

### 🌈 Physical Characteristics

- Skin tones from sun-gold to storm-bronze to deep copper, often with undertones like coral, violet, or tarnished gold.
    
- Hair is thick and dark — styled for protection and pride, adorned with objects of personal meaning (not for beauty, but for remembrance).
    
- Eyes are glassy and deep, often sea-toned — bright with saltwater sheen.
    

---

### 🧿 Folklore & History

- **Nali of the Many Paths** is no longer only a joyful figure. Some stories say she danced the ocean into existence. Others say she danced as the world drowned, refusing to weep.
    
- Spirits in Palm lore are often conflicted — playful but wounded, loving but forgetful. Much like the elves themselves.
    

---

### 🪞 Social Standing & Relations

- Seen by clans like **Yew** and **Baobab** as overly sensual, ungrounded, or unserious — though few would match their resilience.
    
- Have deep kinship with **Gypsum Dwarves**, who also carry laughter as a kind of armour.
    
- With **Ash Elves**, there’s long-standing friction — two proud peoples born of loss but choosing different masks: **grit vs grace**, **fire vs tide**.
