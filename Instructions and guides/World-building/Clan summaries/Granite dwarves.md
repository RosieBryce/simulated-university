Here’s the detailed fact sheet for the **Granite Dwarves**:

---

### 🪨 Granite Dwarves — Clan Profile

**Known As:** The Stoneheart Line  
**Region:** The Ironplate Mountains — high, cold peaks in the northern range with fortified citadels and sheer cliffside dwellings  
**Language/Dialect:** Granska, a terse and formal dialect of Old Dwarvish with clipped vowels and very rigid syntax, often spoken with military precision

---

### 🏔️ Homeland & Environment

- Granite dwarves live in fortresses carved directly into the cold stone faces of Ironplate’s cliffs.
    
- Architecture is monumental and defensive, favouring strong right angles, massive stone blocks, and echoing chambers.
    
- Snowfall is heavy; snowmelt is carefully stored and rationed. Little grows above ground, so most food is imported or farmed in stonewalled terraces deep inside.

### 🗣️ Language & Expression

- Granska is efficient and serious; even poetic forms are spare, usually haiku-like or structured by syllabic count.
    
- Conversation often includes rank, role, or achievement — e.g. “Mason-General Haldrik” or “Stoneborn Third Son Torg.”

### 🛡️ Culture & Traditions

- **The Graven Oath:** Upon reaching adulthood, each Granite dwarf carves their name into the family’s ancestral wall. Once carved, it can never be removed, and must be honoured through service.
    
- **Stonemarch:** An annual pilgrimage across mountain passes to reaffirm unity and resilience. Many die during the trek; their names are added to the Songs of Endurance.
    
- Every family maintains a **“Stone Ledger”** — a physical tablet recording all significant deeds, disgraceful acts, and contributions.

### 💠 Values

- **Discipline** and **honour** are the highest virtues; cowardice and wastefulness are deeply shameful.
    
- Emphasis on **loyalty**, both to kin and to the mountain stronghold.
    
- They prize **stoicism** — suffering should be endured in silence unless it endangers others.
    

---

### 💼 Livelihoods

- Primarily masons, military engineers, stone-armour smiths, siege tacticians, and stone-logisticians.
    
- Famous for crafting **armoured golems**, fortress design, and unbreakable siege implements.
    
- Many serve in elite guards or as mercenaries abroad, highly sought for their discipline.
    

---

### ⛪ Religion & Belief

- Worship a pantheon of stone-forged deities, particularly **Durm, the Bound Anvil**, god of resistance and endurance.
    
- Temples are squat, heavy structures with sacred anvils where new tools and weapons are ritually struck before use.
    
- Ancestor veneration is central — bones are often interred in thick walls, believed to strengthen them spiritually and structurally.

### 💪 Physical Characteristics

- Broadest of all dwarves, with square builds and powerful arms.
    
- Skin is pale grey or stone-brown, often weathered like cliff rock.
    
- Hair is commonly dark grey, white, or black; some ritually shave heads for practical and symbolic reasons.

### 🧱 Folklore & History

- **The Siege of Hearthwall:** When the citadel was under siege for 30 years, Granite dwarves are said to have reshaped the mountain into a death trap that turned the tide.
    
- A central myth tells of **Urdrak the Wall**, a dwarf so stubborn he stood unmoved for an entire winter, fusing with stone and becoming a part of the mountain itself.

### 🏛️ Social Standing & Relations

- Highly respected among dwarves for their strategic minds and unyielding nature.
    
- Sometimes considered humourless or overly rigid, especially by Malachite and Gypsum dwarves.
    
- Distrustful of elves, especially the Holly and Palm clans, whom they view as too changeable or vain.
