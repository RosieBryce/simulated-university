Here is the detailed fact sheet for the **Baobab Elves**:

---

### 🌳 Baobab Elves — Clan Profile

**Known As:** The Vaulted, the Skyrooted, or the Eldest Bough  
**Region:** The Canopy Expanse — a sunlit plateau where ancient baobab trees rise like cathedrals, their trunks hollowed into palatial dwellings and treetop libraries. The land is dry but rich, and the roots run deep — both literally and socially.  
**Language/Dialect:** Oraneth — a refined, slow-spoken dialect known for its layered metaphors and elliptical phrasing. Elites train in rhetorical duelling from childhood. The written form is inscribed vertically, like vines climbing stone.

---

### ☀️ Homeland & Environment

- The Canopy Expanse is dry, golden, and elevated. Rain is rare but revered.
    
- Towering baobabs are not just sacred — they _are_ cities. Some are centuries old, with their own family lineages.
    
- Bridges of silk and vine connect upper canopies
    

---

### 🗣️ Language & Expression

- Oraneth is deliberately slow and full of layered meaning. It is said that a Baobab elf can “insult and bless you in the same sentence, and make you thank them for it.”
    
- Public discourse is performative — debates are ceremonial, and precision is status.
    
- Body language is elegant but restrained. Showing too much emotion is considered crude.

### 🪶 Culture & Traditions

- **The Threading:** Youth must demonstrate verbal mastery by weaving a story that holds five nested meanings — one for self, one for family, one for the court, one for history, one for the tree.
    
- **The Root Archive:** Every Baobab tree has a sealed root-vault containing scrolls, heirlooms, and ancestral codes — rarely accessed, but deeply revered.
    

---

### 💠 Values

- **Legacy over immediacy** — true actions are those that endure across generations.
    
- **Control of self and others** — strength is shown through restraint, cultivation, and influence.
    
- **Knowledge as inheritance** — not freely given, but guarded and tested.
    

---

### 💼 Livelihoods

- Often serve as **advisors**, **archivists**, **strategists**, **court magicians**, and **high diplomats**.
    
- Renowned for **memory magic**, **binding oaths**, **hierarchical enchantments**, and **magical architecture** grown from root to vault.
    
- Their textile artisans weave **baobab silk**, embroidered with stories so complex they take years to read.
    

---

### 🌳 Religion & Belief

- Revere **Orus’Kai, the Memory Tree**, said to exist outside time. Baobab elves believe their lineage extends back to its first seed.
    
- Shrines are living — shaped directly into the tree’s inner core, hidden and private.
    
- Belief in **aerial ancestry**: the higher you dwell in the canopy, the closer you are to the divine.
    

---

### ☀️ Physical Characteristics

- Skin is richly toned — ranging from ochre to deep gold to burnt sienna, often glowing in sunlight.
    
- Hair is thick and coiled, often piled high or bound with gold thread, amber beads, or silk wraps.
    
- Eyes are bronze, gold, or amber — often outlined in pigment to symbolise lineage or rank.
    

---

### 🧿 Folklore & History

- Tell of **Selat the Speaker**, who once held an entire kingdom hostage with a single sentence, and freed them with a second.
    
- Fables revolve around **growth through cunning**, **grace under pressure**, and **lessons encoded in parables**.
    
- Whisper of “the roots below,” where disinherited nobles sometimes plot to regrow their place in the sun.
    

---

### 🪞 Social Standing & Relations

- Considered the most **elite** of the elven clans — wealthiest, most formally educated, most tradition-bound.
    
- Resentment from **Ash** and **Palm** elves, who view Baobab aloofness as hypocrisy.
    
- Often in complex trade-political entanglements with **Pyrite** and **Obsidian** dwarves — relationships defined by old contracts and mutual advantage, not friendship.
