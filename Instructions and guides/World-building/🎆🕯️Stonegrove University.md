**Stonegrove University** is a bold, collaborative venture between Elven and Dwarven scholars, set in a reclaimed and reimagined campus nestled at the meeting point of forest and mountain. Once an offshoot of Eldengrove’s more obscure faculty system, it has since been reshaped by Stoneborn-trained pedagogues into a thriving, inclusive institution.

At Stonegrove, students still walk vaulted cloisters and study in deep stone libraries humming with old enchantments, but they also engage in project-based learning, community collaboration, and transdisciplinary work that challenges conventional academic hierarchies. The university retains legacy systems — formal robes, arcane schedules, mysterious advisory councils — but these are constantly interrogated and repurposed.

Workshops are often held in open forges or tree-canopied studios. Assessments may involve oral storytelling, peer-led symposia, and regenerative design. Governance is shared across student, staff, and community groups — with Dwarves bringing procedural clarity and Elves bringing long-view deliberation. The result is a place of tension and transformation — not quite utopia, but a compelling rehearsal for one.
