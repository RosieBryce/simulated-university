     SECTION 2 — PROJECT ORIGINS
===================================================== -->
<section id="origins">
  <div class="container">
    <span class="section-label">SECTION 01 / ORIGINS</span>
    <h1>Project origins</h1>
    <p>Universities are medieval institutions – Oxford predates the printing press, the Renaissance, the Black Death, the Ottoman Empire, and the existence of the United States. Modern universities have inherited legacy structures like the academic year, programmes, lectures, and exams from a period of history long since passed. Most of us who work in higher education spend a significant portion of our time working around them rather than with them. We are trying to do something genuinely innovative within structures that predate the internet by several centuries.</p>
    <p>The question I kept returning to was: what would high-quality, genuinely student-centred pedagogy look like if you could design for it from scratch? If you weren't inheriting the scaffolding, if there were no programmes that have 'always been this way', no assessment calendar that exists because it has always existed, what would you actually build?</p>
    <p>A good way of exploring this, I decided, was to build the university in a fantasy realm. And why not throw AI into the mix while I'm at it?</p>
    <p>I worked with one AI to do some world-building, and then with another agent to code a simulated student population journeying through the UK HEI-adjacent institution we called 'Stonegrove'. This project is the result of that experiment.</p>

        <p>Elder Grove is an elven institution, ancient and prestigious, built on the conviction that knowledge is precious, and that the value of students' learning has a direct relationship with the opacity of the teaching strategy.</p>
        <p>To enrol as a student at Elder Grove, you must first pass a series of trials, which are notoriously unfair and 'meta'. Once you have enrolled, your next test is to work out from the stack of scrolls presented to you where and when your first lecture might be. Nothing about Elder Grove has changed in several centuries, which is also considered a point of pride. Elder Grove has literal ivory towers.</p>
        <p>This is satire, of course – you can draw your own analogies.</p>

        <h3>Stoneborn</h3>
        <span class="species-pill dwarf-pill">Dwarven institution</span>
        <p>Stoneborn is the dwarven institution and the opposite in almost every respect. It is pedagogy-first: learning is mostly project-based, and knowledge is shared between staff and students freely. There is no formal course structure, students stay until they feel they have learned enough to move on. There is no final degree awarded, no classification or stratification of students. Soft skills such as collaboration and negotiation are given the same status as knowledge accretion.</p>
        <p>Side note: I'd be really interested in hearing from people who want to shape up this vision into something more concrete.</p>

        <p>Stonegrove is the middle sister. An awkward peacetime collaboration between the species of dwarves and elves. It has inherited elven structures: programmes, modules, pathways, assessment deadlines, annual progression boards but is genuinely trying to apply dwarven pedagogical values within them. This tension between the inherited architecture and the intended ambition is where most of us seem to work in the real world.</p>

      <p>Stonegrove is home to 14 clans, eight dwarven, and six elven. Each clan arrives with its own history and its own relationship to education, its own socioeconomic distribution, its own genes and patterns of disability prevalence.</p>
      <p>Each student is modelled as an individual agent in the simulation. Each student has a personality profile drawn from the Big Five, eight motivation dimensions, social dynamics, and stress responses that evolve across the academic year.</p>
      <p>Outcomes are modelled at student level, shaped by who they are and what they encounter week by week, module by module, year by year, with just a hint of extra randomness built in. The data at the other end is just a record of what emerges from that process.</p>

      <h2 class="sub-h2" style="font-family:var(--font-heading);font-weight:700;font-size:1.55rem;color:var(--text-navy);margin:2.5rem 0 0.75rem;position:relative;padding-bottom:0.85rem;">Inspired by Dwarf Fortress</h2>
      <p>This project would not exist without Dwarf Fortress, the colony simulation by Bay 12 Games in which an entire world is simulated from the day 0 across whole geological epochs before your seven dwarves even arrive. Your dwarves have personalities, memories, preferences, opinions, and strong feelings about art. They form friendships, mourn their dead, and occasionally go completely berserk because someone killed their cat, or because they did not find exactly the right type of bone for their flute-making project. You do not manage them so much as try to shepherd them in a general direction while they pursue their own agendas. The outcomes of your colony are emergent properties of individual dwarves living their lives, not directives from above.</p>
      <p>That agent-first philosophy is what Stonegrove is built on. Enormous and sincere credit to Tarn and Zach Adams.</p>

      <h2 class="sub-h2" style="font-family:var(--font-heading);font-weight:700;font-size:1.55rem;color:var(--text-navy);margin:2.5rem 0 0.75rem;position:relative;padding-bottom:0.85rem;">A note on emergence</h2>
      <div class="pullquote">
        <p>I found a student in one of my test runs, amusingly given the name 'Doni Pickface', a dwarf of the Flint clan. Poor Doni ended up having to repeat their third year three times: the simulation gives students a gradually increasing reluctance to withdraw as they accumulate time at the university - the sunk-cost effect, modelled at agent level. Doni kept failing the year, kept deciding not to leave, and eventually (finally!) passed on their third attempt.</p>
        <p>I didn't decide for that to happen - it just emerged from how the model works. I really enjoy that the system produces stories I did not write.</p>

     SECTION 6 — THE GAP
===================================================== -->
<section id="gap">
  <div class="container">
    <span class="section-label">SECTION 05 / THE GAP</span>
    <h1>What you will find in the data</h1>
    <p>There is a gap in the data. Elven students outperform dwarven students by something like eighteen percentage points in good degree attainment — that is, in the proportion achieving a First or 2:1 — and this persists across cohorts, across programmes, and across all seven academic years. You will find it fairly quickly.</p>
    <p>The gap is not there because there is a species modifier in the model that says elves score higher. It emerges because dwarven clans are more likely to enter university with a range of previous qualifications, more likely to have certain disabilities, more likely to come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Those factors compound through engagement patterns, through assessment performance, through progression rates, and what you observe at the top is a gap that looks like it is about species but is actually about structure.</p>
    <p>If you're interested in modelling the effects of policy interventions on differential outcomes, this codebase and dataset may go some way to supporting you to test ideas before trying them out in the real world. Disclaimer, of course – this is a fantasy universe, dwarves and elves are not humans, and my simulation does not capture more than the tiniest, most meagre sliver of the lives of real people.</p>

    <h1>What could you build?</h1>
    <p class="build-intro">This simulation and its data are tools for making things with. Scrappy, proof-of-concepts that you could take back to your institution to test further. Some starting points:</p>
    <div class="build-grid">

      <div class="build-card">
        <div class="card-label">Build idea 01</div>
        <h4>Interactive dashboard</h4>
        <p>Use AI to build an interactive dashboard to explore the data, without touching Power BI or a line of code yourself.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="build-card">
        <div class="card-label">Build idea 02</div>
        <h4>An early alert tool</h4>
        <p>By week six, the weekly engagement data carries signals about which students are struggling: attendance dropping, participation falling, stress rising. Use AI to build a machine learning tool that surfaces those signals clearly enough that a personal tutor could actually act on them in time. A question to ask of the data is 'who is heading into trouble, and how early can you tell?'</p>
      </div>

      <div class="build-card">
        <div class="card-label">Build idea 03</div>
        <h4>A gap decomposition tool</h4>
        <p>The eighteen-point gap in good degree attainment is not one thing. Build an AI enabled tool that pulls that number apart and see how much of it comes from prior qualifications, how much from socioeconomic rank, how much from disability and could change when you change one factor in the config files.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="build-card">
        <div class="card-label">Build idea 04</div>
        <h4>A programme recommendation tool</h4>
        <p>Students' clan characteristics, personality profiles, and motivation dimensions correlate with programme fit in ways that are transparent and documented in the code. Use AI to build a recommendation tool for students to select appropriate programmes.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="build-card">
        <div class="card-label">Build idea 05</div>
        <h4>Model the effect of implementing disability support</h4>
        <p>In the current simulation, no students have disability support plans, so disabilities have a detrimental effect on participation and therefore on marks. Use AI to model a system that mitigates this effect, and observe how this affects marks, NSS, graduate outcomes…</p>
      </div>

      <div class="build-card">
        <div class="card-label">Build idea 06</div>
        <h4>AI enabled data explorer</h4>
        <p>Use AI to build a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) chatbot that answers questions like 'which Dwarf clans had the highest dropout rates? Does this vary by faculty?'</p>
      </div>

      <div class="build-card">
        <div class="card-label">Build idea 07</div>
        <h4>Persona-based focus group simulator</h4>
        <p>Given a proposed policy change (e.g. 'remove all resit opportunities'), prompt an LLM to roleplay as five different student archetypes drawn from the data and debate the policy.</p>

    <h1>This project was built with AI</h1>
    <p>AI helped with both the world building and the writing of the code. The world and lore building was created in collaboration with ChatGPT-4o, which turned out to be extremely well-suited to enthusiastically creating an entire fantasy world.</p>
    <p>The pipeline code was vibe-coded with Claude. The dataset was generated by running the simulation.</p>
    <p>AI made the building faster, but it did not decide what to build. The three-university framework, the design philosophy, the decision to make the simulation run on agent level all came from me, through years of working in UK higher education and thinking carefully about what makes the problems hard.</p>
