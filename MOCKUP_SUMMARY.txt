================================================================================
DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
================================================================================

AUDIENCE:
Education policy professionals at higher-education hackathons

KEY MESSAGES (embedded in all three mockups):
1. The dataset is synthetic and fully reproducible (no privacy concerns)
2. The attainment gap is emergent, not innate (stems from SES, disability, engagement)
3. The data is actionable for policy design and intervention testing
4. Three hackathon prompts ready to build on

TONE:
Academically rigorous but playful. Fun without losing credibility.
Makes complex policy issues accessible and engaging.

PROJECT CONTEXT
================================================================================

Stonegrove University is a synthetic dataset for education policy research.
It simulates 7 years of longitudinal student lifecycle data using a fantasy
setting (Middle-Earth clans) to avoid privacy concerns while maintaining
realistic statistical structures.

The dataset is designed specifically for:
- Education policy hackathons
- Equitable practice improvement research
- Intervention design and counterfactual modelling
- Awarding gap analysis
- Student progression prediction

All data is fictional. All insights are real.

================================================================================
SUPPORT / QUESTIONS
================================================================================

Each mockup includes inline comments in the CSS and HTML sections.
All code follows semantic HTML5 standards and modern CSS practices.
