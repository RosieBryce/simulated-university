we are going to generate some images using a cohesive style that looks like it was the same artist. You will be asked to generate 16 images of characters from particular dwarf and elven clans in our fantasy world.

Here is what the image should be like:
🎨 Image Generation Prompt (Anime JRPG Artbook Style)
A full-body, stylised character portrait in the style of a Japanese role-playing game (JRPG) artbook, reminiscent of Tales of Symphonia or Final Fantasy Tactics character sheets. The artwork is in a semi-realistic anime style with clean linework, soft cel-shading, and vivid but muted colours.

The character stands in a confident, expressive pose — evocative of their role or personality — against a textured parchment or painted backdrop (not pure white), with subtle brushstroke effects and warm undertones.

Lighting is diffuse and soft, with a focus on clarity and mood. The character is fully visible from head to toe, with all costume elements cleanly represented.

The background should be abstract or atmospheric — like soft painterly clouds, faint magical motifs, or landscape silhouettes in faded ink — providing context without drawing attention away from the figure.

Include detailed costume elements, unique accessories, and culturally evocative design motifs. Emphasize the character’s posture, eyes, and silhouette for expressive storytelling.

Do not crop the head or feet. Image should be vertical, portrait orientation, and styled like an illustrated game manual or collector’s edition character sheet.
