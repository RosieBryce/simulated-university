Here is the detailed fact sheet for the **Alabaster Dwarves**:

---

### 🪨 Alabaster Dwarves — Clan Profile

**Known As:** The Hollowbound  
**Region:** The Pale Reaches — abandoned quarries, crumbling cities, and chalk plains in the far south, often overlooked and underresourced  
**Language/Dialect:** Albaic — a faded and fragmentary dialect, once a courtly tongue, now spoken in softened cadences and patchwork phrases

---

### 🏚️ Homeland & Environment

- The Pale Reaches are lands of collapse: vast hollowed quarries, broken towers, and old mines long stripped of value.
    
- Their towns are built from reclaimed stone and salvaged debris, often riddled with subsidence and overlooked by trade routes.
    
- Dust clings to everything. Crops struggle. Water is drawn from deep, unstable shafts.
    

---

### 🗣️ Language & Expression

- Albaic was once the language of diplomacy and refinement, but is now worn thin — poetic, but fragile.
    
- Elders preserve old songs and phrases like cracked porcelain; young Alabaster dwarves often speak a clipped, utilitarian pidgin of Albaic and common dwarvish.
    
- Expression is layered — bitter humour, dry understatement, and carefully coded defiance.

### ⚒️ Culture & Traditions

- **The Shard Rite:** At age 13, youths carve a piece of local stone and carry it as a burden until they find a place to leave it — usually after a personal loss, a leaving, or a vow.
    
- **Stone Vigil:** Community members take turns watching over unsafe tunnels and half-collapsed buildings. The act is both literal and symbolic — care in the face of indifference.
    
- **Patchcraft:** Repair and resourcefulness are cultural pillars. Cracked walls, worn clothes, and broken tools are lovingly mended and often more beautiful after repair.
    

---

### 💠 Values

- **Endurance in neglect** — the ability to persist without recognition is the highest mark of character.
    
- **Care as defiance** — to rebuild, to repair, to nurture is seen as an act of resistance.
    
- Deep suspicion of opulence; wealth is regarded with irony or disdain unless it is used to uplift others.
    

---

### 💼 Livelihoods

- Known for **salvage work**, **restoration stonecraft**, **fine surface carving**, and **quiet architecture** — homes that flex rather than fall.
    
- Many serve as underpaid labourers in the cities of richer clans, or migrate for work.
    
- Excellent at maintaining infrastructure others deem unworthy — sewerworks, mine supports, boundary walls.
    

---

### 🕯️ Religion & Belief

- Belief systems are quiet and domestic — private altars, ancestor tokens, and remembrance candles are common.
    
- Some honour **Shira the Unseen**, a half-forgotten spirit of watchfulness and survival.
    
- Rituals focus on continuity, memory, and uncelebrated acts of care.
    

---

### 🕳️ Physical Characteristics

- Pale-skinned, often with chalky or powder-dusted complexions; prone to rashes and weathering from poor conditions.
    
- Hair ranges from dull brown to pale flaxen, often worn cropped or wrapped in cloth to protect it from quarry dust.
    
- Eyes are soft-toned: pale blue, amber-flecked, or silt-grey, often heavy-lidded from fatigue.
    

---

### 🧷 Folklore & History

- One story tells of **The White Mason**, a faceless figure who rebuilds ruined homes at night with unmatched care, then disappears.
    
- The tale of the **Stone That Waited** tells of a fallen carving carried by generations until a young dwarf found the exact niche it was meant to rest in — centuries after its creation.
    

---

### 🪞 Social Standing & Relations

- Widely seen as poor cousins or forgotten kin by other dwarf clans.
    
- Malachite dwarves sometimes act as allies or patrons; Granite and Flint dwarves tend to see them as failed or fallen.
    
- Not trusted by most elves — seen as unpredictable due to their mix of refinement and bitterness — though some Rowan and Yew elves express solidarity through shared experiences of loss.
