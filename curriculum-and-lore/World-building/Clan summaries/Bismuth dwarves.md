Here is the detailed fact sheet for the **Bismuth Dwarves**:

---

### 🌈 Bismuth Dwarves — Clan Profile

**Known As:** The Fractallers  
**Region:** The Prismvault — a crystalline canyon network deep beneath geothermal strata, lined with bismuth veins, angular mineral growths, and radiant thermal springs  
**Language/Dialect:** Kaleid — a shifting, polyphonic dialect full of layered meanings, tonal modulation, and mirrored idioms. It blends spoken word, hand signs, and iridescent glyphs etched on reflective surfaces.

---

### 🌀 Homeland & Environment

- The Prismvault glows faintly from within: geothermal light dances off spiralling mineral formations, creating a constantly shifting spectrum of colour and shadow.
    
- Architecture bends traditional dwarven geometry into twisting, stepped, Escher-like forms. Homes shimmer like illusions, but are structurally ingenious.
    
- No two dwellings look alike — rooms adapt, grow, or refract depending on the inhabitant’s needs or mood.
    

---

### 🗣️ Language & Expression

- Kaleid cannot be fully understood in a single form — one must _see_ it, _hear_ it, and _feel_ it. It’s a language of simultaneous meanings.
    
- Expressions shift with context. A single phrase may mean “I love you,” “I see your edges,” or “You’re out of tune” depending on the speaker’s aura and intention.
    
- Communication values fluidity over clarity — a well-crafted ambiguity is considered more elegant than a plain statement.
    

---

### 🧬 Culture & Traditions

- **The Blooming:** Adolescents ritually shed old names and forms through symbolic “fracturing” — a personal or crafted object is shattered and reformed to reflect a new self.
    
- **Facet Days:** Celebrations of multiplicity — each person displays or performs a different “facet” of themselves: musician, oracle, trickster, sage.
    
- **Tesserae Lore:** Knowledge is encoded in coloured tiles arranged in shifting mosaic patterns. No two are the same; only by patterning them correctly can the truth emerge.
    

---

### 💠 Values

- **Fluid identity** — they believe selves are not fixed but ever-refracting.
    
- **Multiplicity over monolith** — contradiction is not weakness, but richness.
    
- Deep respect for **beauty born of fracture** — many believe only broken things are truly alive.
    

---

### 💼 Livelihoods

- Renowned as **alchemists**, **architects of impossible spaces**, **mirror-scribes**, and **adaptive toolsmiths**.
    
- Masters of materials science, colour metallurgy, and heat-channelled illusions.
    
- Often serve as **counsellors**, **designers**, and **pattern-interpreters** across dwarven and elven lands — but only where their ambiguity is welcome.
    

---

### 🔮 Religion & Belief

- Honour **Rilatha of the Shardveil**, a divine force of multiplicity, transition, and radiant contradiction.
    
- Temples are mirror halls where worshippers wear layered masks and chant songs in canon — always slightly out of sync.
    
- Personal altars are often small kaleidoscopic shrines that change depending on how they’re viewed.
    

---

### 🌈 Physical Characteristics

- Skin is typically medium-toned with an iridescent shimmer: hints of violet, turquoise, or gold flash beneath the surface in angled light.
    
- Hair ranges from platinum and pink-gold to oil-black with shifting undertones — often dyed, plated, or tessellated with ceramic or glass beads.
    
- Eyes refract colour — many appear multicoloured or as shifting gradients.
    

---

### 🧿 Folklore & History

- Tell of **Yunel the Shardborn**, a dwarf who broke into seven selves and lived seven lives simultaneously to learn the truth of the world.
    
- A foundational myth recounts **The Prism’s Collapse** — a tragic cataclysm that shattered the original Vault, birthing their culture of fragmentation and resilience.
    

---

### 🪞 Social Standing & Relations

- Respected by Malachite and Gypsum dwarves for their philosophical depth and beauty; distrusted by Granite and Flint clans for their evasiveness and refusal to “settle.”
    
- Elves — particularly Rowan and Palm — admire them as artists, mystics, and visionaries, though Baobab elites may see them as dangerously unstable.
    
- Within their own ranks, hierarchy is non-linear — wisdom is measured not in age or mastery, but in how many facets of self one has dared to reveal.
