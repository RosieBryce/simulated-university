### 🪨 Sandstone Dwarves — Clan Profile

**Known As:** The Weathered Kin  
**Region:** The Amber Fold — vast tablelands of layered sandstone, sunlit ravines, and wind-shaped spires in the central lowlands  
**Language/Dialect:** Sundermouth — a warm, expressive dialect with round vowels, rich proverbs, and a cadence shaped by story, song, and wind

---

### 🏜️ Homeland & Environment

- The Amber Fold is a landscape of monumental beauty — striated cliffs, echoing valleys, and sun-bleached ridgelines.
    
- Sandstone dwarves build outward, not inward — their settlements are carved into cliff faces and connected by rope-bridges, switchbacks, and light towers.
    
- They live close to the sky and open air, often in harmony with the wind and shifting stone.

### 🗣️ Language & Expression

- Sundermouth is renowned for its poetic turn — riddles, rhymes, and proverbs form the backbone of conversation.
    
- Gestures, facial expression, and posture are integral to meaning — often hard for outsiders to read.
    
- Their storytelling is communal, improvised, and layered with metaphor. Arguments are often resolved through competing parables.

### 📚 Culture & Traditions

- **The Linewalk:** At dusk, children walk the edge of their home cliffs to learn balance — physically and morally. A rite of trust, not courage.
    
- **Dustcall:** At equinox, dwarves scatter carved stone dust into the wind, symbolising lessons learned and errors released.
    
- **Archive Stones:** Rather than writing on paper, their lore is preserved in wind-sung carvings and resonant cliff chimes.

### 💠 Values

- **Flexibility** — they believe the wise learn when to yield, like sandstone shaped by wind.
    
- **Community Voice** — no decision is made alone. Wisdom comes through many perspectives, slowly weathered into shape.
    
- They value **beauty in transience** — especially things marked by time: worn tools, smooth stones, laughter lines.

### 💼 Livelihoods

- Experts in **acoustic engineering**, **sunlight architecture**, **windcraft**, and **freestanding sculpture**.
    
- Trade in dyes, glass-sand, soundstones, and sandstone carvings that change tone when struck.
    
- Many serve as **mediators**, **orators**, and **ritual designers** across the continent.

### ☀️ Religion & Belief

- The wind is sacred — especially **The Whisper Current**, believed to carry truth between beings.
    
- They believe the world is constantly shaping and reshaping itself, and their role is to listen, adjust, and record.
    
- No temples — worship is in the open, during sunrise or high wind, with songs cast out to the cliffs.

### 🏵️ Physical Characteristics

- Skin has sun-warmed hues: ochre, bronze, dusty rose. Their faces often carry fine lines from wind exposure.
    
- Hair is usually coarse and sandy-toned — ginger, tan, rust, or light brown — worn bound or wrapped in fabric bands.
    
- Eyes tend toward golden, hazel, or terracotta tones — bright in the sun and full of mirth.

- They share close bonds with **Holly** and **Palm** elves, especially in cultural festivals and sunlit rituals.
    
- Some elven scholars apprentice with Sandstone dwarves to learn tonal carving or wind-song composition.
