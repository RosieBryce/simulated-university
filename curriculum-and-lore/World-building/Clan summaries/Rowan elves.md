Here is the detailed fact sheet for the **Rowan Elves**:

---

### 🍂 Rowan Elves — Clan Profile

**Known As:** The Hearthbinders or Emberkin  
**Region:** The Firegroves — a fertile highland woodland where rowan trees grow in thick, protective clusters around volcanic springs and ancient stone circles. The land smells of warm ash and red fruit.  
**Language/Dialect:** Emberish — a lively, emotive dialect filled with rhythm and inflection. It’s full of idioms rooted in cooking, firekeeping, storytelling, and home-making. Their script resembles looping knotwork, often carved or burned into wood.

---

### 🔥 Homeland & Environment

- The Firegroves are warm year-round due to underground geothermal vents and shallow lava channels.
    
- Rowan trees are sacred — believed to house protective spirits. Their red berries are seen as charms against misfortune.
    
- Homes are built low to the ground with central hearths, often in family compounds ringed by fruit trees, story-poles, and braided fences.
    

---

### 🗣️ Language & Expression

- Emberish is spoken with dramatic expression and emphasis. Tone and gesture are essential — telling a story flatly is a cultural faux pas.
    
- Hospitality phrases are sacred. “Come in from the dark,” “The kettle knows your name,” and “Rest where the flame lives” are traditional greetings.
    
- Jokes, fables, and riddles are considered a vital part of conversation — especially around the fire.

### 🏡 Culture & Traditions

- **The Kindling Rite:** At adolescence, a Rowan elf must tend an elder’s hearth for a full cycle of the moon — without letting it go out. This symbolises learning to hold others' stories and needs.
    
- **The Emberweave:** A festival in which families trade woven sashes, each bearing embroidered memories of the past year.
    
- **Storypoles:** Large carved totems outside each home. Every notch is a tale told, a kindness received, or a lesson learned.

### 💠 Values

- **Hospitality as power** — not weakness, but the strength to make others feel safe.
    
- **Stories over silence** — truth is best remembered through shared narrative.
    
- **Warmth, kinship, and everyday magic** — a cup of tea can be as sacred as a spell.
    

---

### 💼 Livelihoods

- Beloved as **teachers**, **bards**, **apothecaries**, and **hearth-priests**.
    
- Excel in **hearth-magic**, **protective charms**, **food alchemy**, and **oral history**.
    
- Often serve as **mediators**, **caretakers**, and **keepers of sacred flame**.
    

---

### 🔥 Religion & Belief

- Honour **Branna the Flamemother**, a domestic spirit said to live in every true hearth. Branna listens to stories and tends the coals of the soul.
    
- Shrines are hearths themselves — fire tended with offerings of red berries, sweetbread, and ash-carved charms.
    
- Believe the dead return briefly with every shared meal, listening from the edge of the flame.
    

---

### 🍂 Physical Characteristics

- Warm, ruddy complexions with glowing undertones — copper, honey, rosewood, or chestnut.
    
- Hair is typically red, auburn, or golden brown — worn in practical, lived-in styles: braids, buns, half-knots.
    
- Eyes are ember-orange, deep brown, or berry-red. Many have freckles that resemble sparks.
    

---

### 🧿 Folklore & History

- Tell of **Nolwen of the Longfire**, who kept a fire burning for a century so her people could return home, carrying its coals in her own body.
    
- Myths often feature small moments of kindness changing the course of history — a shared crust of bread saving a kingdom.
    

---

### 🪞 Social Standing & Relations

- Loved by many other elven clans — especially **Ash** and **Palm** — for their warmth and easy company.
    
- Viewed with some suspicion by **Baobab elves**, who see them as too sentimental or “small-minded.”
    
- Deep mutual respect with **Malachite** and **Gypsum** dwarves — they’ve historically shared trade routes, family feasts, and stories at the borders of their lands.
