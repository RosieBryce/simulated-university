Here is the detailed fact sheet for the **Flint Dwarves**:

---

### 🪨 Flint Dwarves — Clan Profile

**Known As:** The Sparked  
**Region:** The Ashen Marches — a rugged region of sharp flint hills, smouldering fault lines, and ancient volcanic beds in the west  
**Language/Dialect:** Flintspeech — an angular, clipped dialect known for its biting idioms and fast-paced cadence; favours bluntness over politeness

---

### 🌋 Homeland & Environment

- Flint dwarves live in regions shaped by fire and pressure — their cities are carved into black glass cliffs, surrounded by ever-smouldering ground fissures.
    
- The terrain is treacherous: loose shale, molten pockets, and sudden spark-fires are common. But the mineral wealth — obsidian, flint, firestone — is unmatched.
    
- Homes are fortified bunkers, heavily fireproofed and layered with cooling chambers.
    

---

### 🗣️ Language & Expression

- Flintspeech is direct and forceful; pausing mid-sentence is considered a sign of doubt or deceit.
    
- Communication is often confrontational by nature — not out of hostility, but as a test of strength and honesty.
    
- Sayings often involve heat, striking, or pressure: e.g. “Better to spark and fail than smoulder in silence.”

### 🔧 Culture & Traditions

- **The Trial of Sparks:** At age 16, each Flint dwarf must forge a tool or weapon in a volcanic forge — without assistance. If it breaks under pressure, they must begin again.
    
- **Match Duels:** Disputes are settled through high-stakes tests of speed, strength, or flamecraft — not violence, but performance.
    
- **Spark Festivals** involve controlled explosions of coloured flame and molten-sand art displays to honour creativity under constraint.

### 💠 Values

- Above all, they value **resilience**, **speed**, and **truth told plainly**.
    
- Honour is won by **usefulness**, not rank — a younger dwarf who builds a better blast furnace earns more respect than an elder who talks in circles.
    
- **Ingenuity under pressure** is their ideal — they believe greatness is only forged when the heat is highest.

### 💼 Livelihoods

- Renowned for their skill in **weapon-smithing**, **pyrotechnics**, **mechanical engineering**, and **flintglass shaping**.
    
- Inventors, tinkerers, and architects of explosive devices and pressure-driven machines.
    
- Frequently contracted by other dwarves and elves alike for fortress traps, automata, and volcanic mining operations.
    

---

### 🔥 Religion & Belief

- Revere **Embrath, the Ember-Heart**, a force-deity representing heat, motion, and the moment of transformation.
    
- Places of worship are foundries and lava-glow chapels; fire is never extinguished in their temples — only fed or shaped.
    
- Their sacred texts are etched onto metal that must be held with tongs to read.
    

---

### ⚙️ Physical Characteristics

- Often leaner than other dwarves, but heavily scarred, tanned, and soot-marked from forgework.
    
- Eyes are often deep-set and flicker like coals: red-brown, amber, or jet black with ember flecks.
    
- Hair ranges from coal-black to ember-red, frequently cropped short or bound back in leather.

### 🧨 Folklore & History

- Myths tell of **Thirza Flamegrip**, the first dwarf to bottle a volcanic storm, forging the Sparkhammer that never cools.
    
- A cautionary legend of **The Glass King** tells of a ruler who refused to bend, and shattered — a parable against inflexibility.
    

---

### 🪞 Social Standing & Relations

- Sometimes mistrusted by other clans for their explosive temperaments and love of chaos, but respected for their skill and reliability.
    
- Cordial but competitive with **Granite dwarves**, whom they tease for being too slow.
    
- Avoids most elves, save for **Ash elves**, who share a respect for controlled destruction and rebirth.
