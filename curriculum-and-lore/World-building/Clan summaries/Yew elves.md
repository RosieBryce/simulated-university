Here is the detailed fact sheet for the **Yew Elves**:

---

### 🌑 Yew Elves — Clan Profile

**Known As:** The Deathkeepers or Veilbound  
**Region:** The Hollowmere — a mist-wreathed forest of ancient yew groves, burial barrows, and quiet lochs where time flows oddly and light is filtered through smoke-hued canopies  
**Language/Dialect:** Nyareth — a slow, echoing tongue with elongated vowels, often spoken in paired phrases (one for the living, one for the dead). It is half-spoken, half-sung, with a sonorous resonance that lingers in the air.

---

### 🌫️ Homeland & Environment

- The Hollowmere is unnervingly still. Moss muffles footsteps, and ancient yews rise from burial mounds older than memory.
    
- Settlements are carved into dead trees, hollowed hills, and root-buried halls. The line between home and tomb is blurred.
    
- A soft, perpetual mist hangs in the air, giving the forest a liminal, dreamlike quality.
    

---

### 🗣️ Language & Expression

- Nyareth is meditative, careful, and layered. Speech is slow and ceremonial; pauses matter as much as words.
    
- Yew elves often speak in **dyads**: every blessing is mirrored by a lament, every greeting by a farewell.
    
- Non-verbal communication is rich: bowed heads, mirrored gestures, shadow-scripts traced in the air.

### ⚰️ Culture & Traditions

- **The Veiling:** Upon reaching adulthood, each Yew elf dons a ceremonial veil and must walk the “Paths of Silence” for three days, communing with the ancestral dead.
    
- **Rootcall Rituals:** Death rites involve planting a yew sapling into the heart of the deceased, believed to root their memory in the world.
    
- **Echo Chambers:** Memory is preserved in song-vaults — chambers where one’s voice is captured and played back in eerie harmony generations later.
    

---

### 💠 Values

- **Continuity of memory** — life is a thread in a much longer weave.
    
- **Intimacy with death** — not morbid, but reverent and honest.
    
- **Stillness, integrity, and respect for the veil between worlds** — which is not a wall, but a membrane.
    

---

### 💼 Livelihoods

- Often serve as **funerary priests**, **ancestral lorekeepers**, **diviners**, and **soul-scribes**.
    
- Renowned for crafting **mourning jewelry**, **deathmasks**, and **veilglass** — a rare, smoky material used to glimpse the past.
    
- Their artisans also work with yew wood, producing **death-harps** and curved **funerary bows** used only in memory hunts.
    

---

### 🕯 Religion & Belief

- Revere **Myaril the Twice-Born**, a deathless spirit who crossed the Veil and returned carrying the names of every elf who will ever die.
    
- Shrines are yew circles planted over generations — each tree grown from the death of a kin.
    
- Ceremonies often involve choral whispering, bell chimes, and ritual walking in spirals.
    

---

### 🌫️ Physical Characteristics

- Skin is often pale, with undertones of blue-grey, lavender, or sepia.
    
- Hair tends toward white, black, or ash-blond, often worn in long, uncut waves or wound into veil-braids.
    
- Eyes are smoky, amber, or violet — sometimes appearing clouded even when vision is sharp.
    

---

### 🧿 Folklore & History

- Tell of **Sareth, the Griefwalker**, who bargained with death itself to retrieve a lost child and paid the price by aging backwards.
    
- Songs speak of **The Breathless War**, when Yew elves fought in silence for a hundred years to seal a breach in the Veil.
    

---

### 🪞 Social Standing & Relations

- Seen as eerie or unsettling by some elven clans — especially the flamboyant Palm or the brash Rowan.
    
- Deeply respected by **Slate dwarves**, with whom they share rituals of fracture and remembrance.
    
- Often serve as **neutral arbiters** in inter-clan disputes, especially where loss or legacy is at stake.
