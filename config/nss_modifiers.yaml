# NSS (National Student Survey) Response Configuration — Stonegrove University
# Generates one response per final-year student (programme_year == 3), including repeats.
# Scores on a 1-5 scale; % positive = proportion scoring >= 4.
# Real NSS benchmark: most themes sit around 3.5-4.2; assessment & student voice typically lower.

# Base scores (1-5) before individual modifiers
base_scores:
  teaching_quality:         3.70
  learning_opportunities:   3.60
  assessment_feedback:      3.30   # historically the lowest-scoring NSS theme

  organisation_management:  3.40
  learning_resources:       3.65
  student_voice:            3.20   # typically lowest; students feel less heard
  overall_satisfaction:     3.60

# Per-theme engagement drivers
# Applied as: weight * (engagement_value - 0.5)  [engagement is 0-1 scale, centre at 0.5]
