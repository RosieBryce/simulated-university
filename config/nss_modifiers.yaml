# NSS (National Student Survey) Response Configuration — Stonegrove University
# Generates one response per final-year student (programme_year == 3), including repeats.
# Scores on a 1-5 scale; % positive = proportion scoring >= 4.
#
# Target % positive (calibrated to real UK NSS benchmarks):
#   teaching_quality:         ~84%   learning_opportunities:  ~80%
#   assessment_feedback:      ~65%   (most variable: mark-sensitive, wide spread)
#   academic_support:         ~74%   organisation_management: ~62%  (lowest)
#   learning_resources:       ~78%   student_voice:           ~68%
#   overall_satisfaction:     ~72%
#
# Base scores account for net modifier drift observed in simulation:
#   positive drift themes (engagement-driven): teaching_quality +0.35, learning_opps +0.35,
#     student_voice +0.26, learning_resources +0.10
#   negative drift themes (stress/disability-driven): academic_support -0.21,
#     organisation_management -0.13, assessment_feedback -0.04

# Base scores (1-5) before individual modifiers
base_scores:
  teaching_quality:         3.70   # net drift +0.35 -> mean ~4.05 -> ~84% positive

  assessment_feedback:      3.78   # net drift -0.07 -> mean ~3.71 -> ~65% positive (most variable)
  academic_support:         4.05   # net drift -0.21 -> mean ~3.84 -> ~75% positive

  student_voice:            3.50   # net drift +0.26 -> mean ~3.76 -> ~68% positive
  overall_satisfaction:     3.95   # blend-weighted -> mean ~3.82 -> ~73% positive

# Per-theme engagement drivers
# Applied as: weight * (engagement_value - 0.5)  [engagement is 0-1 scale, centre at 0.5]
