# Year progression rules for Stonegrove University
# Base probabilities + individual modifiers. All progression modelled at student level.

# Pass threshold: all modules must be >= this mark to pass the year
pass_threshold: 40

# Base probabilities (before modifiers)
# Applied when student passes the year
base_progression_probability: 0.90   # If pass: 90% progress to next year
base_withdrawal_after_pass: 0.10     # If pass: 10% withdraw

# Applied when student fails the year
base_repeat_probability: 0.60        # If fail: 60% repeat
base_withdrawal_after_fail: 0.40     # If fail: 40% withdraw

# Individual modifiers (additive to log-odds, then converted back to probability)
# Positive = more likely, negative = less likely
modifiers:
  # Conscientiousness: high -> more likely to progress/repeat (stick with it)
  conscientiousness_progression: 0.5   # per 0.1 above 0.5
  conscientiousness_repeat: 0.3
  conscientiousness_withdrawal: -0.4   # high conscientiousness -> less withdrawal

  # Academic drive: high -> more likely to progress, less withdrawal
  academic_drive_progression: 0.4
  academic_drive_repeat: 0.2
  academic_drive_withdrawal: -0.5

  # Neuroticism: high -> slightly more withdrawal
  neuroticism_withdrawal: 0.2

  # Performance: better marks (even if pass) -> more likely to progress
  # avg_mark_above_50_per_point: e.g. 55 avg -> +0.05 to progression
  performance_progression: 0.01   # per point above 50
  performance_withdrawal: -0.01   # per point above 50

  # "Other stuff going on" – reduces progression likelihood
  # Significant disability: requires_personal_care, wheelchair_user, blind, communication_difficulties, or 2+ disabilities
  significant_disability_progression: -0.6   # less likely to progress
  significant_disability_withdrawal: 0.3     # more likely to withdraw
  # Caring responsibilities (when student model has this field)
  caring_responsibilities_progression: -0.4
  caring_responsibilities_withdrawal: 0.2
