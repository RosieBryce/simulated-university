# ============================================================
# Personality Refinement Modifiers — Stonegrove University
#
# Additive adjustments applied to base personality traits (0–1 scale).
# Traits: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness,
#   neuroticism, academic_curiosity, perfectionism, resilience,
#   leadership_tendency, social_anxiety, extra_curricular_propensity,
#   career_ambition, community_engagement
# ============================================================


# ------------------------------------------------------------
# DISABILITY MODIFIERS
#
# Structure:
#   defaults — applied to all clans unless overridden
#   clan_overrides — per-clan overrides; only listed traits replace
#                    the default; all others remain as default
#
# Rationale for clan_overrides:
#   Better-resourced clans (higher SES base, strong institutional culture)
#   have more embedded support — reasonable adjustments, peer networks,
#   specialist staff — so the same disability carries lower academic burden.
#   Lower-resource clans face compounding barriers.
#
#   High-support clans: granite, bismuth, obsidian (Dwarves)
#                       baobab, yew, holly (Elves)
#   Low-support clans:  flint, alabaster, sandstone, palm
