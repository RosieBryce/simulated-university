# Project Tracker

Tickets and progress for the Stonegrove University simulation. For **both** humans and AI: pick up here to see what’s next and where we are.

## How to use

- **CURRENT.md** — What we’re working on right now (1–3 items). Update when you start/finish.
- **BACKLOG.md** — What we plan to do next. Move items to CURRENT when starting.
- **DONE.md** — Completed work (short log). Add when something is finished.
- **TICKETS/** — Optional: one file per ticket (e.g. `TICKETS/001-assessment-system.md`) for bigger items.

## Workflow

1. **Starting work**: Move a BACKLOG item to CURRENT (or add to CURRENT). Optionally create a TICKETS/nnn-title.md.
2. **While working**: Keep CURRENT up to date (what’s in progress, what’s blocked).
3. **Finishing**: Move completed item to DONE (one line + date). Remove from CURRENT.
4. **Planning**: Add new items to BACKLOG.

## Conventions

- One “current” focus is enough; 2–3 is fine if they’re small.
- Log in DONE with: `- [date] Short description (e.g. ticket ref or doc updated)`.
- If something is blocked, note it in CURRENT and why.
